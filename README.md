# TAanvas
Taanvas was a collaborative repo for the CEN5035 Software Engineering class
However, this repository is created to post my work alongside the team.

Usage:
Install express with node:
```npm install express```

Start the development server:
```node server.js```

# Week 3,4: Knowing about agile methods and the waterfall method
Agile Development
What is Agile? It's a straightforward approach to get products to market faster. It focuses on incremental development and delivery. It's more flexible and embraces changes during the project.
Key Concepts discussed in Class:
User Stories/Use Cases: We talked about these to describe how users interact with a system, like a login/signin feature on a landing page.
Refactoring: This is all about cleaning up code to make it more readable and easier to maintain without changing what it does. We can do this by renaming functions or breaking down long functions into smaller ones.
Test Automation: Automating tests using scripts.
Pair Programming: Working with a partner on the same project at the same time.

# Week 5,6,7: key concepts discussed were || System Qualities:
Availability: A system is ready to accept requests.
Security: A system is only accessible to authorized internal users and can resist intrusion.
Safety: A system must not cause harm to its users.
Reliability: A system delivers the service as it was originally specified.
Resilience: A system's ability to deliver critical services effectively.
Maintainability: A system is easy to fix.
|| Threats to a System and How to Address Them
The main threats to a system are faults, which can lead to errors (bugs) and ultimately, failure. To combat these threats, two key strategies are used:
Diversity: This involves using diverse and independent components.
Redundancy: This is the use of duplicate components.
For example, an airplane's software controller is a system. In an ideal situation, only one controller would be needed. However, to ensure safety, redundancy is used. Instead of a single primary controller, a secondary controller is also used to deliver the control variable to the hardware, making the system more secure. In a more complex setup, multiple controllers can "vote" on a command to determine the correct control variable.
